# Lessons Learned

 If your question is "What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?" take a look ⬇️

### 1. Pagination of films in the carousel

#### Problem

During development of the BeMovies application, a problem was identified with the display of films in the carousel. By default, the TMDB API returns a limited list of films (first 20 results). This resulted in an incomplete carousel that did not display all the films available.
